                skill levels</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 1/4 cups flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375 °F (190 °C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with the granulated and brown sugars until light and fluffy, 
                    about 2–3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Beat in eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition, then stir in the vanilla extract</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this mixture to the wet 
                    ingredients, mixing just until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
                <li>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly soft. Rotate sheets halfway 
                    through if your oven bakes unevenly.</li>
                <li>Let cookies rest on the baking sheet for 2–3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
