            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Mac and cheese is a comforting American dish featuring <u>tender</u> elbow pasta enveloped in a creamy cheese sauce—typically made with cheddar, milk, and butter—for a rich, velvety texture. Baked or stovetop, it often includes a golden breadcrumb or extra-cheese topping that adds a <strong>crisp contrast</strong>. Beloved for its <strong>simple, indulgent</strong> flavor, mac and cheese is a go-to at family dinners, potlucks, and weeknight meals.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>8 oz elbow macaroni</li>

                    <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup shredded mild cheddar or Monterey Jack</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook until just al dente (about 1 minute less

                    <li>In the same pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk constantly for 1–2 minutes
